# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props is short for properties and is needed to for the class to get files from the main file. I mainly use this to get the file that I one from the main file like for example. If I want to use the function from another file and use it in my class files, I would need to use this.props for me to be able to use the file that I want.

  Researched answer: Props are arguments needed to pass data into react components. It is a component to communicate with another component and is use to send data to each other.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: DOM events handle events between javascript and react. DOM is a short term for document object model and is use whenever the programmer assign a method where the user interacts with the screen with a mouseclick, etc. For example, a user needs to be able to interact with the button that is made by the programmer. For this to happen, is needs to have the method to click the button, which is the onClick button, and whenever the button is click, it does whatever is programed to the method like turn green into color white.

  Researched answer: It is an even actions that is performed bu either the user or by the web browser instead. This can be triggered on any part of  the document. It is with the combination of functions, and it will be executed if the events occurs. Dom events also allows the web page to be interactive.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object-oriented programming is creating a class into another file. This helps makes programming much easier as I separate each file into each own properties. One example is making a square, I would create a square in a different class and everytime I like to call it, I would just call the class name in the main file to produce the square. This would make it more cleaner than having is on the same file. There is also the parent and a child class thats helps shorten the program. I would make a parent class if I know that it has a lot of similar properties to what I am creating. For example, cat, dog, mouse would be called child class and animals is the parents class because they have a lot of properties in common like the eyes, legs, food etc. The difference from functional programming is that functional stays on the main file while object oriented programming is created in another file.

  Researched answer: Object-oriented programming relies on the concept of class and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple reusable pieces of code blueprints and is used to create individual instances of objects. Object-oriented programming is based on class and objects while functional programming relies on functions.


4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: Integer is a whole number while float has a decimal attach to it. Most of the time, integer it what we always use if a problem only needs a whole number. But when it comes to solving problems with decimals, like if I want to get the PI, which is 3.141414, then I would have to use float. I can also choose how many number of decimals I can see by using the function round() on whatever float to show how many decimals a programmer what on his program.

  Researched answer: Integers are whole number that can be positive or negative and also a 0. A float contains decimal point.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: In some languages, whenver a function is created, return is needed to return the result inside the function. In ruby language, implicite return does not need that return word inside a function. Ruby is design to return what is inside the function without having to use the return value. 

  Researched answer: Implicit return means that every block in ruby will return the value of the last line automatically. Thus, the return keyword is not needed for ruby language.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: An instance variable has a name beginning with @, and its scope is confined to whatever object self refers to.

2. PostgreSQL: PostgreSQL, also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. 

3. Ruby on Rails: Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License.

4. ORM: Objectâ€“relational mapping in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems using object-oriented programming languages.

5. Active Record: Active Record facilitates the creation and use of business objects whose data requires persistent storage to a database.
